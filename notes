first video done.
Annoying to have to type "rspec ~/rails/todos/spec/features/user_visits_homepage_rspec.rb"

saturday 11/21
started watching Upcase tutorial for TDD.
forked github repo, but nothing in it :(, waste of time.
Failing test passed!  changed version of rspec from 3.0.4 to 3.3.0.
Then test failed.
