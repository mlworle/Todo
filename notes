Sunday 11/22
evening: kept getting no route "/session/new" when in config/routes.rb there was clearly as instructed 
  resource :session, only: [:new, :create]

rake routes didn't have session/new but sessions/new
so I changed routes.rb to
  resources :session, only: [:new, :create]
Note plural.
This works. 

morning:first video done.
Annoying to have to type "rspec ~/rails/todos/spec/features/user_visits_homepage_rspec.rb"

saturday 11/21
started watching Upcase tutorial for TDD.
forked github repo, but nothing in it :(, waste of time.
Failing test passed!  changed version of rspec from 3.0.4 to 3.3.0.
Then test failed.
