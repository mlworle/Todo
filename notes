Monday 11/23

BTW: looking over these notes. the problem on Sunday with session/new was because I didn't include a url. took about 2 seconds on the video and I blew right through it.

Note to self:  SLOW DOWN

10:00 met with mentor, Edward Loveall. Rememember to thank him publicly when you are a respectable coder. 

Unit testing 
UGH! all the errors yesterday were typos!


Sunday 11/22

before bed: Video 5 min 11
having trouble not getting pending Todo 
error is "undefined method completed?"
NEED to get rid of all the blue lines for gems!!!!!

after dinner:  go over Video 4, refactor

evening: kept getting no route "/session/new" when in config/routes.rb there was clearly as instructed 
  resource :session, only: [:new, :create]

rake routes didn't have session/new but sessions/new
so I changed routes.rb to
  resources :session, only: [:new, :create]
Note plural.
This works. 

morning:first video done.
Annoying to have to type "rspec ~/rails/todos/spec/features/user_visits_homepage_rspec.rb"

saturday 11/21
started watching Upcase tutorial for TDD.
forked github repo, but nothing in it :(, waste of time.
Failing test passed!  changed version of rspec from 3.0.4 to 3.3.0.
Then test failed.
